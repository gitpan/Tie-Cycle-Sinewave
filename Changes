Revision history for Perl extension Tie::Cycle::Sinewave

0.03 2006-07-25 14:13:26 UTC 
    - Fixed up a silly error in the synopsis example code.
    - Refined the code to deal with 2*PI wraparound (only shows up on
      64-bit platforms. Not sure if this fix is sufficient).
	- The README talked about Build.PL instead of Makefile.PL.

    - Couldn't get Build.PL to play nicely under smoke tests (the dreaded
      "Too early to specify a build action 'Build'." error). So I threw
      it away and use ExtUtils::MakeMaker instead.
    - t/pod.t and t/pod_coverage.t were subsumed by t/00-basic.t
    - detabbed source files
