Revision history for Perl extension Tie::Cycle::Sinewave

    - Couldn't get Build.PL to play nicely under smoke tests (the dreaded
      "Too early to specify a build action 'Build'." error). So I threw
      it away and use ExtUtils::MakeMaker instead.
    - t/pod.t and t/pod_coverage.t were subsumed by t/00-basic.t
    - detabbed source files

0.01 2005-04-05 15:00:09 UTC
    - initial release
