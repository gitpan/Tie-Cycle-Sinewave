    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

DESCRIPTION

This module is used to create scalars whose values vary between a
minimum value and a maximum value, and path taken between the two
values follows the curve of a sinewave.

Callbacks can be fired off when it passes through the maximum or
minimum, which can be used to modify the cycle's parameters (amplitude
and period).

A number of sample programs are available in the eg/ directory. If
you don't have easy access to this they are available on the web,
at http://search.cpan.org/~DLAND/

STATUS

This module is under active development. The test suite achieves 100%
coverage according to Devel::Cover.
